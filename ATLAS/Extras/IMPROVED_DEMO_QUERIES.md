# üéØ Improved Demo Queries - Cross-Disciplinary Appeal

## Why These Examples Work Better

### ‚ùå **Previous Issue:**
- Too STEM-heavy (Physics + Calculus + CS)
- Limited audience appeal
- Narrow use case demonstration

### ‚úÖ **New Approach:**
- **Cross-disciplinary** coverage (STEM + Liberal Arts + Communication)
- **Broader audience appeal** for startup interviews
- **Demonstrates versatility** across academic domains

## üìã **Updated Demo Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Study Planning** (Study Planner Agent)
**Query:** *"I'm struggling to manage my time with multiple deadlines - I have a calculus assignment, a Civil War history essay, and a persuasive speech presentation all due this week."*

**Why This Works:**
- Shows **time management crisis** (relatable problem)
- **Multiple disciplines** demonstrate broad applicability  
- **Real academic pressure** situation
- **ADHD accommodations** in scheduling

**Expected Output:**
- Task prioritization across disciplines
- ADHD-optimized time blocks
- Subject-specific energy allocation
- Crisis management protocols

---

### **Scenario 2A: STEM Content** (Note Writer Agent)
**Query:** *"Create visual study notes for calculus derivatives that match my learning style."*

**Expected Output:**
- Visual concept maps with derivative rules
- Color-coded formula reference cards
- Step-by-step mathematical guides
- Pattern recognition tools

---

### **Scenario 2B: Liberal Arts Content** (Note Writer Agent)  
**Query:** *"Create study notes for my Civil War history essay that work with my visual learning style."*

**Expected Output:**
- **Visual timeline** of Civil War events
- **Cause & effect maps** showing connections
- **Key figures reference** with quick profiles
- **Essay structure guide** with visual framework
- **Historical mnemonics** and memory aids

---

### **Scenario 2C: Communication Skills** (Note Writer Agent)
**Query:** *"Help me create visual notes for my persuasive speech on climate change."*

**Expected Output:**
- **Speech structure map** with visual outline
- **Persuasion techniques guide** (color-coded)
- **Visual aids planning** framework
- **Delivery checklist** with confidence builders
- **Practice framework** for rehearsal

---

## üéØ **Demo Strategy by Audience**

### **For Tech-Focused Interviewers:**
- Start with **Scenario 1** (shows technical architecture)
- Use **Scenario 2A** (STEM content generation)
- Emphasize: AI architecture, personalization algorithms, data integration

### **For Education/General Audience:**
- Start with **Scenario 1** (universal time management problem)
- Use **Scenario 2B** (Liberal Arts appeal)
- Emphasize: Accessibility, learning disabilities, broad applicability

### **For Business/Communication Roles:**
- Start with **Scenario 1** (professional skill - time management)
- Use **Scenario 2C** (Communication skills)
- Emphasize: Professional development, soft skills, workplace application

## üó£Ô∏è **Enhanced Talking Points**

### **Cross-Disciplinary Value:**
*"Notice how ATLAS isn't just for STEM students - it adapts to history majors, communication students, anyone who needs academic support. The same AI architecture that understands mathematical learning also understands historical analysis and public speaking skills."*

### **Learning Style Universality:**
*"Visual learning accommodations work whether you're memorizing derivative rules or Civil War timelines. ADHD support helps with math homework and essay writing equally."*

### **Market Expansion:**
*"This isn't just a CS tool - it's for the entire university. Liberal arts students struggle with time management just as much as engineering students."*
