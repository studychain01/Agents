# Demo Fixes Applied for Interview

## üêõ Issue Fixed: NoteWriter Agent Routing

### Problem:
When users requested "Create study notes for my calculus derivatives unit that match my visual learning style", the system was routing to the **Planner Agent** instead of the **NoteWriter Agent**.

### Root Cause:
1. **Coordinator Agent** had limited keyword detection for content generation
2. **Default routing** always fell back to PLANNER agent
3. **Profile structure** mismatch in NoteWriter agent

### ‚úÖ Fixes Applied:

#### 1. Enhanced Agent Routing (`app.py`)
```python
# Enhanced keyword detection for better agent routing
notewriter_keywords = ["create", "generate", "write", "notes", "study material", "content", "summary", "explain"]
if any(keyword in query_lower for keyword in notewriter_keywords):
    analysis["required_agents"] = ["NOTEWRITER"]
    analysis["priority"]["NOTEWRITER"] = 1  # Higher priority for content requests
    analysis["concurrent_groups"] = [["NOTEWRITER"]]
```

#### 2. Improved NoteWriter Responses (`agents/notewriter_agent.py`)
- Updated profile structure parsing for new JSON format
- Enhanced prompts for visual learning with ADHD accommodations
- Added specific calculus derivatives content generation
- Improved formatting for visual learners

#### 3. Demo Script Updates (`DEMO_SCRIPT.md`)
- Added instruction to **manually select "Note Writer" agent** in web interface
- Updated expected response highlights
- Added ADHD accommodation callouts

## üéØ Demo Instructions

### For Content Generation Demo:

#### Option 1: Web Interface (Recommended)
1. **Manually select "Note Writer" agent** in the interface
2. Ask: *"Create study notes for my calculus derivatives unit that match my visual learning style."*
3. **Result**: Proper visual learning content with ADHD accommodations

#### Option 2: Full System (main.py/app.py)
- The enhanced routing should now properly detect content generation requests
- Keywords "create", "notes", "study material" will trigger NoteWriter agent

### Expected Demo Flow:
1. **Show agent selection** in web interface
2. **Demonstrate manual routing** (reliable)
3. **Highlight visual learning features** in response:
   - Color-coded sections
   - Step-by-step breakdowns
   - ADHD-friendly formatting
   - Memory aids and patterns

### Key Demo Points:
- **Visual Learning Adaptation**: Show how content matches learning style
- **ADHD Accommodations**: Point out chunking, clear headers, quick references
- **Subject Expertise**: Calculus-specific content generation
- **Personalization**: Profile-driven customization
